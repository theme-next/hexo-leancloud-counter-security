```yml
leancloud_counter_security:
  enable_sync: true
  app_id: <<your app id>>
  app_key: <<your app key>>
  server_url: <<your server url>> # Required for apps from CN region, eg: https://leancloud.cn
  username: <<your username>> # Will be asked while deploying if is left blank
  password: <<your password>> # Recommmended to be left blank. Will be asked while deploying if is left blank
```

If `leancloud_counter_security` not specified (or commented), plugin will totally disabled.

### NexT theme

This plugin integrated in «NexT» and after plugin enabled in main Hexo config, need to enable options in NexT config:

```yml
leancloud_visitors:
  enable: true
  app_id: <<your app id>>
  app_key: <<your app key>>
  # Dependencies: https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-leancloud-counter-security
  security: true
```

You should build the Leancloud background first to make the counter active.

After that, install this plugin and config it to make the counter safe.

### Console Command

```bash
hexo lc-counter register <<username>> <<password>>
```

or

```bash
hexo lc-counter r <<username>> <<password>>
```

Register a user in your Leancloud database for authority control.

## TroubleShooting

### fail to sync records to the leancloud database

For purpose of avoiding the 429 error code (Too Many Request) from leancloud, this plugin use a local database to store the records which have been successfully synchronized to the leancloud. Only the records that are not in the local database will be synchronized. This feature reduces the request quantity to avoid 429 error. The local databases is a json file named `leancloud.memo` in `<<blog directory>>/source`. Delete the `leancloud.memo` will not cause other flaws.

If you failed to sync records to the leancloud and you are sure about the plugin causes the fault. You can delete the `leancloud.memo` and deploy again. The command is following.

```bash
rm <<blog directory>>/source/leancloud.memo
hexo d
```
